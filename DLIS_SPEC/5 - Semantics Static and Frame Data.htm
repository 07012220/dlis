<P>Each Logical  File begins with a File Header Logical Record that serves as an 
 identifying label for the Logical File.  A File Header Logical Record  is an 
Explicitly Formatted Logical Record (EFLR) with Type FHLR.  A File Header 
Logical Record contains a single <EM>FILE-HEADER</EM> Set.  A FILE-HEADER Set is 
unnamed and contains exactly one Object  with two Attributes as defined in 
Figure 5-1. The Origin Subfield of the Name of the File-Header  Object must 
reference the Defining Origin (see §5.2.1).   The Identifier  Subfield is a 
single arbitrary character. 
<P>The Template Attributes for this Set must contain  explicitly the Label and 
Representation Code Characteristics and  only the Label and Representation Code 
Characteristics.  The Count,  Units, and Value Characteristics take the global 
defaults.  The  Value Characteristics are later defined in the Object's 
Attributes.

  <LI><A name="cmt_5_1_1">1.</A>The <EM>Sequence-Number</EM> Attribute is  the 
  ASCII representation of a positive integer that indicates the  sequential 
  position of the Logical File in a Storage Set.  The Value  of the 
  Sequence-Number Attribute must meet the following requirements:   
  <UL>
    <LI>The number of ASCII characters is fixed at 10 characters,        right 
    justified and padded to the left with blank        characters (ASCII code 
    32<SUB>10</SUB>).         That is, the character representing the        
    least significant digit of the Sequence-Number is in byte 10.    
    <LI>The Sequence-Number of any Logical File,        expressed as an integer, 
    must be greater than the        Sequence-Number of the Logical File that 
    immediately precedes        it in the Storage Set.  The Sequence-Number of 
    the first        Logical File in a Storage Set may be any positive integer.  
     </LI></UL>
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_1_2">2.</A>The <EM>ID</EM> Attribute is a descriptive 
   identification of the Logical File.  The Value of the ID Attribute  must meet 
  the following requirement:   
  <UL>
    <LI>The number of ASCII characters is fixed        at 65 characters (width 
    of a standard printed page).   </LI></UL></LI></UL>
<P>Since the File Header Logical Record is required  to be written as a single 
Logical Record Segment (see §2.2.3.1),  a general file management utility can 
identify File Header Logical  Records, modify the Value of the Sequence-Number 
Attribute, and  retrieve the Values of both the Sequence-Number and ID 
Attributes  knowing only the following about DLIS Logical Records (see Figure 
 5-2):   
<UL>
  <LI>Bit 1 in byte 3 of a File Header Logical        Record Segment is set and 
  byte 4 contains the numeric code FHLR        (see Appendix A).    
  <LI>The Value (excluding the length byte) of        the Sequence-Number 
  Attribute is in        bytes 48 through 57 inclusive.    
  <LI>The Value (excluding the length byte) of        the ID Attribute is in 
  bytes 60 through 124 inclusive.    
  <LI>When searching for a File Header Logical        Record on Record Storage 
  Units, only the first        Logical Record Segment        in each Visible 
  Record needs to be read.         It begins following the        two-byte 
  Format Version, which follows        the two-byte Visible Record Length.       
    The first byte of the first Logical Record Segment is byte        5 of the 
  Visible Record in a Record Storage Unit.   </LI></UL>

<H4><A name="5_2">5.2</A> Origin Logical Record (OLR)</H4>Origin Logical 
 Records are Explicitly Formatted Logical Records of Type OLR that  contain 
Objects that provide information about the original conditions  under which the 
information in the Logical File was acquired or  created.  Origin Logical 
Records may contain Set Types <EM>ORIGIN </EM>and <EM>WELL-REFERENCE-POINT</EM>. 
<H5><A name="5_2_1">5.2.1</A> Origin Objects</H5>ORIGIN Objects uniquely 
identify Logical Files and  describe the basic circumstances  under which 
Logical Files are created.   ORIGIN Objects also provide  a means for 
distinguishing different instances of a given entity. Each Logical File must 
contain at least one ORIGIN  Set, which may contain one or more ORIGIN Objects.  
The first Object  in the first ORIGIN Set is the <EM>Defining Origin</EM> for 
the Logical  File in which it is contained, and the corresponding Logical File 
 is called the Origin'’s <EM>Parent File</EM>.  It is intended that  no two 
Logical Files will ever have Defining Origins with all Attribute  Values 
identical. Figure 5-3 defines the Attributes of an ORIGIN Object.

  <CAPTION align="bottom"><B>Figure 5-3. Attributes of Origin 
  Object</B></CAPTION></TABLE>
<P>Comments:  
<DL>
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_1"><B>1.</B></A> The <EM>File-ID</EM> Attribute is an 
  exact  copy of the ID Attribute of the File-Header Object of the Parent  File, 
  i.e., the Logical File for which this Origin Object is the  Defining Origin.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_2"><B>2.</B></A> The <EM>File-Set-Name</EM> Attribute is 
  the  name of a <EM>File</EM> <EM>Set</EM>, a group of Logical Files related 
   according to Producer-defined criteria to which the Parent File  belongs.  
  The File Set is an arbitrary grouping of a set of Logical  Files and has no 
  DLIS semantic meaning.  The File-Set-Name Attribute  is not expected to be 
  unique for all File Sets.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_3"><B>3.</B></A> The <EM>File-Set-Number</EM> Attribute 
  is  a random number, called the <EM>File Set</EM> <EM>Number</EM>, that  is 
  used to distinguish the Logical Files of one File Set from the  Logical Files 
  of another File Set.  This number should be such that  there is a high 
  probability that it uniquely identifies the File  Set.  This number should be 
  the same for all Logical Files of a  given File Set.  This Attribute must be 
  present, even when the  File-Set-Name  Attribute is absent.  In that case, it 
  is considered to apply to  the File Set consisting of the single current 
  Logical File.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_4"><B>4.</B></A> The <EM>File-Number</EM> Attribute is 
  the  <EM>File</EM> <EM>Number</EM> of the Parent File relative to the File 
   Set specified by the File-Set-Name Attribute.  File Numbers for  a File Set 
  are positive and increase in the order in which the Logical  Files of the File 
  Set are created.  File Numbers for a File Set  need not increase sequentially.
   It should be true, with a high probability,  that no two Logical Files will 
  ever have the same File Set Number  and File Number combination. Notice that 
  there is no specific relationship  defined for File Numbers of Logical Files 
  in the same Storage Set.  In particular, a File Set may or may not coincide 
  with the Logical  Files of a Storage Set.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_5"><B>5.</B></A> The <EM>File-Type</EM> Attribute is a 
  Producer-specified  <EM>File</EM> <EM>Type</EM> and signifies the general 
  contents of the  Parent File or the circumstances under which the Parent File 
  was  created.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_6"><B>6.</B></A> The <EM>Product</EM> Attribute is the 
  name  of the software product (e.g., the wellsite "operating"  system) that 
  produced the Parent File.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_7"><B>7.</B></A> The<EM> Version</EM> Attribute is the 
  version  of the product specified by the Product Attribute.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_8"><B>8.</B></A> The <EM>Programs</EM> Attribute is a 
  List  of the names of a specific programs or services, operating as part  of 
  the software specified by the Product Attribute, that were used  to generate 
  the data contained in the Parent File.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_9"><B>9.</B></A> The <EM>Creation-Time</EM> Attribute is 
  the  date and time at which the Parent File was created.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_10"><B>10.</B></A> The <EM>Order-Number</EM> Attribute is 
  a  unique accounting number associated with the acquisition or creation  of 
  the data in the Parent File.  It is typically known as the  <EM>Service Order 
  Number</EM>.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_11"><B>11.</B></A> The <EM>Descent-Number </EM> Attribute 
  is  meaningful to the Producer.  The meaning of this number is specified  by 
  the Producer to the Consumer by means external to the DLIS.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_12"><B>12.</B></A> The <EM>Run-Number</EM> Attribute is 
  meaningful  to the company specified in the Company Attribute.  Its use is 
   specified  to the Producer by this company by means external to the DLIS.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_13"><B>13.</B></A> The <EM>Well-ID</EM> Attribute is a 
  codified  identifier of the well in or about which measurements were taken.  
  Whenever applicable, the API Well Number should be used.  This  is a unique, 
  permanent, numeric identifier assigned to a well in  accordance with the 
  American Petroleum Institute Bulletin D12A,  January, 1979.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_14"><B>14.</B></A> The <EM>Well-Name</EM> Attribute is 
  the name of the well.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_15"><B>15.</B></A> The <EM>Field-Name</EM> Attribute is 
  the  name of the Field to which the well belongs.  If there is no Field,  then 
  the value of this Attribute should be WILDCAT.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_16"><B>16.</B></A> The <EM>Producer-Code</EM> Attribute 
  is  the Producer’s identifying code. The Producer is the company whose 
   authorized agent generated the Logical File using software programs 
   developed under the sponsorship of the company.  This code is assigned  on 
  request by <A href="mailto:jim.theriot@posc.org">POSC</A>. A list of current 
  Company Codes for Producers may be obtained from the same source.   
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_17"><B>17.</B></A> The <EM>Producer-Name</EM> Attribute 
  is  the Producer’s business or organization name  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_18"><B>18.</B></A> The <EM>Company</EM> Attribute is the 
  name  of the client company for which the data was acquired or computed, 
   typically the operator of the well.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_19"><B>19.</B></A> The <EM>Name-Space-Name</EM> Attribute 
  specifies  the name of the dictionary in which dictionary-controlled Object 
   Names are administered for this Origin.  Each Producer is expected  to 
  administer or subscribe to a dictionary of Object Names from  which meaningful 
  definitions can be derived.  
  <DD><A name="cmt_5_3_20"><B>20.</B></A> The <EM>Name-Space-Version</EM> 
  Attribute  specifies the version of the dictionary in which 
  dictionary-controlled  Object Names are administered for this Origin.  
  Dictionary version  N is a superset of dictionary version M whenever N &gt; M. 
  </DD></DL>
<H5><A name="5_2_2">5.2.2 Well-Reference-Point Objects</A></H5>
Well-Reference-Point  Objects specify the Well Reference Point of a well (see 
§4.1.8). Figure 5-4 defines the Attributes of a Well-Reference-Point  Object.

 Set Type <EM>Long-Name</EM>. 
<H5><A name="5_4_1">5.4.1</A> Long-Name Objects</H5>Long-Name  Objects represent 
structured names of other Objects.  A Long–Name  Object is referenced by (an 
Attribute of) the Object of which it  is the structured name. There are 
standardized Name Part Types corresponding  to the Labels of the Attributes of 
the Long-Name Object.  For each  Name Part Type there is a dictionary-controlled 
Lexicon of Name  Part Values.  A Name Part Value is a word or phrase.  The Long 
Name  is built by selecting those Name Part Types that are applicable  to an 
Object and then selecting for each Name Part Type one or more  Name Part Values 
from the corresponding Lexicons. 
<P>A reference to a Long-Name Object establishes  a binding between the Long 
Name and the Identifier of the Object  making the reference.  Over a period of 
time the Long Name that  is associated with a particular Identifier (for a given 
Object Type)  may evolve, but only to clarify its meaning or to exchange a Name 
 Part Value with an industry-preferred synonym.  The Identifier of  the 
referencing Object retains its original usage forever. Figure 5-6 defines the 
Attributes of a Long-Name  Object.

<H4><A name="5_6">5.6</A> Frame Data Logical Records (FDATA)</H4>Frame Data 
 Logical Records are Indirectly Formatted Logical Records that record  Channel 
data packaged in Frames (see §4.1.5). 
<H5><A name="5_6_1">5.6.1 Frames</A></H5>A Frame  constitutes the Indirectly 
Formatted Data of a Type FDATA Indirectly  Formatted Logical Record (IFLR).  The 
Data Descriptor Reference  of the FDATA Logical Record refers to a 
<EM>Frame</EM> Object, defined  in Figure 5–8, and defines the <EM>Frame 
Type</EM> of the Frame. 
<P>Frames of a given Frame Type occur in sequences  within a single Logical 
File.  A Frame is segmented into a <EM>Frame  Number</EM>, followed by a fixed 
number of <EM>Slots</EM> that contain  Channel samples, one sample per Slot.  
The Frame Number is an integer  (Representation Code UVARI) specifying the 
numerical order of the  Frame in the Frame Type, counting sequentially from one. 
 All Frames  of a given Frame Type record the same Channels in the same order.  
The IFLRs containing Frames of a given Type need not be contiguous. 
<P>A Frame Type may or may not have an <EM>Index  Channel</EM>.  If there is an 
Index Channel, then it must appear  first in the Frame and it must be scalar.  
When an Index Channel  is present, then all Channels in the Frame are assumed to 
be "sampled  at" the Index value.  For example, if the Index is depth, then 
 Channels are sampled at the given depth; if time, then they are  sampled at the 
given time, etc.  Minor variations in this assumption  can be declared 
explicitly in <EM>Path</EM> Objects,  which are described later. 
<P>The truth of the assumption just stated is relative  to the measuring and 
recording system used and does not imply absolute  accuracy.  For example, depth 
may be measured by a device that monitors  cable movement at the surface, which 
may differ from actual tool  movement in the borehole.  Corrections that are 
applied to Channels  to improve the accuracy of measurements or alignments to 
indices  are left to the higher-level semantics of applications. 
<P>When there is no Index Channel, then Frames are  implicitly indexed by Frame 
Number. 
<H4><A name="5_7">5.7 Frame Logical Record (FRAME)</A></H4>Frame Logical 
 Records are Explicitly Formatted Logical Records of Type FRAME that  contain 
Objects that specify the characteristics and form of Frames.  Frame Logical 
Records can contain Set Types <EM>Frame</EM>;, and  <EM>Path</EM>. 
<H5><A name="5_7_1">5.7.1 Frame Objects</A></H5>Each Frame  Object defines a 
Frame Type, lists the Channels recorded in the  Frame Type, and characterizes 
the Index of that Frame Type.  The  Frame Type is equal to the Name of the Frame 
Object.  In addition,  each Frame Object specifies whether the contents of the 
Frames of  that Frame Type are encrypted. Figure 5-8 defines the Attributes of a 
Frame  Object.

  example of an increasing sequence of  Index values.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_8_4">4.</A>The <EM>Spacing</EM> Attribute; can be used  to 
  indicate a constant spacing of the Index from one Frame to the  next.  Its 
  value is the signed difference of the later minus the  earlier Index between 
  any (and every) two successive Frames of a  given Frame Type.  Thus, the 
  Spacing Attribute is negative if the  Index is decreasing (e.g., an up log) 
  and is positive if the Index  is increasing (e.g., a down log).  Note that 
  when Attribute Spacing  is present, then Attribute Direction is not required. 
  <BR>Presence of this Attribute guarantees to  the Consumer that Index spacing 
  will be constant for the current  Frame Type throughout the Logical File.  If 
  the Index spacing is  allowed to change, then this Attribute must be absent. 
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_8_5">5.</A>The <EM>Encrypted</EM> Attribute; is used  as a 
  flag.  That is, only its presence or absence has semantic meaning.  Its 
  presence indicates that IFLRs containing this Frame Type are  encrypted.  Its

  Encrypted Frames typically contain information  considered proprietary by the 
  Producer.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_8_6">6.</A>The <EM>INDEX-MIN</EM> Attribute specifies  the

  </LI></UL>
<H5><A name="5_7_2">5.7.2 Data Paths</A></H5>The fundamental  recorded log data 
consists of a sequence of values (i.e., a Channel)  traversing a <EM>Locus</EM> 
in space and time.  A Locus in space and  time is a sequence of distinct points, 
each of which, in the most  general case, has a three-dimensional 
<EM>Position</EM> coordinate,  and a <EM>Time</EM> coordinate.  The sequence
 {Value<SUB>i</SUB>, Position<SUB>i</SUB>, Time<SUB>i</SUB>} is called a 
<EM>Data Path</EM>, and each member  of the sequence is called a <EM>Step</EM> 
on the Data Path.   The sequence  {Position<SUB>i</SUB>, Time<SUB>i</SUB>} is 
the Locus of the Data Path.  Note that it  is possible for two points on a Locus 
to occupy the same Position  in space so long as they occupy that Position at 
different Times.  In the extreme case, a Locus can have a fixed Position. 
<P>A complete Position coordinate is made up of  three components that 
correspond to the spatial coordinate system  of a well: depth (Borehole or 
Vertical), Radial Drift, and Angular  Drift.  Occasionally, both Borehole and 
Vertical depth components  are known and are recorded together. 
<P>Data Paths are represented as groups of Channels  in Frames.  Some or all of 
the components of a Data Path may be  recorded; other components may be unknown 
or irrelevant.   The {Value<SUB>i</SUB>} sequence,  known as the Data Path's 
<EM>Value</EM> <EM>Channel</EM>, is always  recorded.  The mechanism for 
defining Data Paths is the <EM>Path</EM> Object.  Path Objects are not needed to 
decode Frames, but they  add informational value to the contents of Frames. 
<H6><A name="5_7_2_1">5.7.2.1</A> Path Objects</H6>Path Objects  specify which 
Channels in the Data Frames of a given Frame Type  are combined to define part 
or all of a Data Path, and what variations  in alignment exist. 
<P>The Index of a Frame Type automatically and explicitly  serves as a Locus 
component of any Data Path represented in the  Frame Type whenever Frame 
Attribute INDEX-TYPE has one of the values angular-drift, borehole-depth, 
radial-drift, time, or vertical-depth. Figure 5-9 defines the Attributes of a 
Path Object.

  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_1">1.</A>The <EM>FRAME-TYPE</EM> Attribute references  a

  which the Channels of the current Path are recorded.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_2">2.</A>The <EM>WELL-REFERENCE-POINT</EM> Attribute

  specifies the Well Reference Point for entities specified  by the remaining 
  Attributes of the Path Object.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_3">3.</A>The <EM>VALUE</EM> Attribute references a 
   Channel Object that defines the Value Channel for the current Path.  This may 
  also be a List of references in case multiple Channels  share exactly the same 
  Path features described by the remaining  recorded Attributes of the Path 
  Object.  It is permissible for the  Value Channel also to be one of the Locus 
  coordinates.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_4">4.</A>The <EM>BOREHOLE-DEPTH</EM> Attribute specifies 
   the constant Borehole Depth coordinate for the current Path, or  it 
  references the Channel Object (using Representation Code OBNAME)  that defines 
  a Borehole Depth Channel for the current Path.  This  Attribute should not be 
  present if the Frame Type for the current  Path has an  Index-Type Value of 
  borehole-depth.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_5">5.</A>The <EM>VERTICAL-DEPTH</EM> Attribute specifies 
   the constant Vertical Depth coordinate for the current Path, or  it 
  references the Channel Object (using Representation Code OBNAME)  that defines 
  a Vertical Depth Channel for the current Path.  This  Attribute should not be 
  present if the Frame Type for the current  Path has an  Index-Type Value of 
  vertical-depth.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_6">6.</A>The <EM>RADIAL-DRIFT</EM>Attribute specifies 
   the constant Radial Drift coordinate for the current Path, or it  references 
  the Channel Object (using Representation Code OBNAME)  that defines a Radial 
  Drift Channel for the current Path.  This  Attribute should not be present if 
  the Frame Type for the current  Path has an  Index-Type Value of radial-drift. 
 
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_7">7.</A>The <EM>ANGULAR-DRIFT</EM> Attribute specifies 
   the constant Angular Drift coordinate for the current Path, or it  references 
  the Channel Object (using Representation Code OBNAME)  that defines an Angular 
  Drift Channel for the current Path.  This  Attribute should not be present if 
  the Frame Type for the current  Path has an  Index-Type Value of 
  angular-drift.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_8">8.</A>The <EM>TIME</EM> Attribute specifies the 
   constant Time coordinate for the current Path, or it references  the Channel 
  Object (using Representation Code OBNAME) that defines  a Time Channel for the 
  current Path.  This Attribute should not  be present if the Frame Type for the 
  current Path has an  Index-Type  Value of TIME. <BR>The Time coordinate 
  represents an absolute  date and time if its Representation Code is DTIME.  
  Otherwise, it  represents elapsed time from the date and time specified in the 
   Creation-Time Attribute of the Origin Object.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_9">9.</A>The <EM>DEPTH-OFFSET</EM> Attribute specifies  a 
  <EM>Depth Offset</EM>, which indicates how much the Value Channel  is "off 
  depth".  This is a special case and applies only when there  is a recorded 
  Borehole Depth Channel for the current Path.  Specifically,  if the recorded 
  Borehole Depth for the current Path in a Frame is  D and the known Borehole 
  Depth is D' , then D = D'  + Depth-Offset. <BR>Figure 5-10 illustrates how a 
  Depth Offset  can arise for a particular acquisition model.  The Value Channel 
   is sampled at its <EM>Measure Point</EM>, which is a fixed position  relative 
  to the tool string, whenever a <EM>Data Reference Point</EM> (another fixed 
  position relative to the tool string) passes certain  points along the well.  
  If the latter points are equally spaced  in depth, and if the interval between 
  the Measure Point and the  Data Reference Point is not evenly divisible by the 
  sampling interval,  the Channel is off depth.

  <P></P>
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_10">10.</A> The  <EM>MEASURE-POINT-OFFSET</EM> Attribute 
  specifies a <EM>Measure Point  Offset</EM>, which indicates a fixed distance 
  along Borehole Depth  from the Value Channel’s Measure Point to a Data 
  Reference Point  (see comment 11 and Figure 5-10).  This is a special case 
  that depends  on the data acquisition model and applies only when there is a 
  recorded  Borehole Depth Channel for the current Path. <BR>If the 
  Measure-Point-Offset Attribute is  zero or absent, then the Time Channel for 
  the current Path is explicitly  related to the Value Channel.  That is, in 
  each Frame, V<SUB>i</SUB> is sampled  at T<SUB>i</SUB>. <BR>If the 
  Measure-Point-Offset Attribute is  present and non-zero, then the Time Channel 
  is instead explicitly  related to the Data Reference Point, and is implicitly 
  related to  the Value Channel.  In each Frame, T<SUB>i</SUB> is the time that 
  the Data Reference Point was  at D<SUB>i</SUB>, which is the Frame’s Borehole 
  Depth.   The Value Channel  sample V<SUB>i</SUB> is still considered to be 
  sampled at  D<SUB>i</SUB>, but at a time different  from T<SUB>i</SUB>.   The 
  explicit Time for the Value Channel can be recovered  using the knowledge that 
  at time T<SUB>i</SUB> when the Data Reference Point was at depth 
   D<SUB>i</SUB>, the Value Channel Measure Point was at depth  D<SUB>i</SUB> - 
  Measure-Point-Offset. <BR>Typically, only a single Time Channel per  Origin 
  will be recorded in a Frame Type, the one explicitly associated  with the Data 
  Reference Point.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_5_9_11">11.</A>The <EM>TOOL-ZERO-OFFSET</EM> Attribute  is 
  the distance of the Data Reference Point for the current Path  above the tool 
  string’s Tool Zero Point.  It may be positive or  negative; it is frequently 
  zero.  Specifically, Data Reference Point  = Tool Zero Point + 
  Tool-Zero-Offset. </LI></UL>

  <LI><A name="cmt_5_12_2">2.</A>The <EM>ZONES</EM> Attribute is a List of 
   references to Zone Objects that specify mutually disjoint intervals  over

  <LI><A name="cmt_5_xx_6">6.</A>The <EM>Height</EM> Attribute applies only  to 
  equipment located in the borehole.  It specifies the height of  the bottom of 
  the equipment above the Tool Zero Point when the tool  string containing the 
  equipment is vertical.  This value is positive  when the equipment bottom is 
  above the Tool Zero Point and is negative  when the equipment bottom is below 
  the Tool Zero Point.  There is  normally one piece of equipment for which the 
  height is zero. 
  <LI><A name="7">7.</A>The <EM>Length</EM> Attribute specifies the  length of 
  the equipment and is typically measured from bottom make  up point to top make 
  up point.  It may not apply to surface equipment. <BR>The total length of the 
  tool string may not  equal the sum of the lengths of all the equipment that 
  make up the  tool string, since some equipment may slip over other equipment. 
   Such "slip-on" equipment includes, for example, standoffs,  centralizers, and 
  excentralizers.  Similarly, the height of a piece  of equipment may be 
  independent of the lengths of the equipment  below it. 
  <LI><A name="8">8.</A>The <EM>Minimum</EM>-<EM>Diameter</EM> Attribute 
   applies to equipment used in the borehole.  It specifies a minimum  outer

  <LI><A name="12">12.</A>The <EM>Hole-Size</EM> Attribute applies  to equipment 
  in the borehole.  It specifies the minimum borehole  diameter for which the 
  equipment may reasonably be used. 
  <LI><A name="13">13.</A>The <EM>Pressure</EM> Attribute indicates  the maximum 
  operational pressure rating of the equipment, when applicable.

  <LI><A name="15">15.</A>The <EM>Vertical-Depth</EM>, <EM>Radial-Drift</EM>, 
   and <EM>Angular-Drift</EM> Attributes specify the corresponding position 
   coordinates, relative to the Well Reference Point (see §4.1.8),  of the 
  equipment represented by the current Object.  These Attributes  are intended 
  to be used for surface equipment — for example, a geophone  — that is 
  stationary over a period of time.  These Attributes may  be updated in a 
  Logical File (see Chapter 6) to permit recording  infrequent or slow changes

<H5><A name="5_8_4">5.8.4 Tool Objects</A></H5>Tool Objects  are 
dictionary-controlled Objects that specify ensembles of equipment  that work 
together to provide specific measurements or services.  Such combinations are 
more recognizable to the Consumer than are  their individual pieces.  A typical 
tool consists of a sonde and  a cartridge and possibly some appendages such as 
centralizers and  spacers.   It is also possible to identify certain pieces or 
combinations  of surface measuring equipment as tools. Figure 5-14 defines the 
Attributes of a Tool  Object.

<P>Comments: 
<UL>
  <LI><A name="1">1.</A>The <EM>Properties</EM> Attribute is a List  of Property 
  Indicators (see Appendix C).  The Property Indicators  summarize the 
  characteristics of the Computation and the processing  that has occurred to 
  produce it. 
  <LI><A name="2">2.</A>The <EM>Dimension </EM>Attribute specifies  the array 
  structure of a single value of the current Computation  (see §4.4.4).  
  <LI><A name="3">3.</A>The <EM>Zones</EM> Attribute references a  List of Zone 
  Objects that specify mutually disjoint intervals over  which the value of the 
  current Computation is constant.  A Computation  may have different values in 
  different zones.  When this Attribute  is present, the Computation is said to 
  be Zoned, and it is considered  to be defined only in the zones specified by 
  the Zones Attribute.  It is considered to be undefined elsewhere. <BR>The Zone 
  Objects referenced in this List  must all have the same Domain Attribute 
  Value.  That is, a Computation  Object may only be zoned over a single domain. 
  <BR>The Zones Attribute may be absent, in which  case the Computation is said 
  to be Unzoned.  In this case, the Computation  is considered to be defined 
  everywhere. 
  <LI><A name="4">4.</A>The <EM>Values</EM> Attribute is a List of  Computation 
  values corresponding to the zones listed in the Zones  Attribute.  When the 
  Computation is Zoned, the number of Computation  values is the same as the 
  number of zones referenced, and the  k<SUB>th</SUB> Computation value applies 
  to the k<SUB>th</SUB> zone.   When the Computation is Unzoned, there  is a 
  single Computation value in the Values Attribute. <BR>The Count of the Values 
  Attribute is equal  to the number of Computation values listed (equal to 1 if 
  Unzoned  or determined by the Count of the Zones Attribute if Zoned) 
  multiplied  by the size in elements of each value (determined by the Dimension 
   Attribute).  For example, if there are three zones, and if Dimension  = {3, 
  4, 128}, then there are three Computation values listed, each  1,536 elements 
  big, making the Count of the Values Attribute equal  to 3*1,536 = 4,608. 
  <LI><A name="5">5.</A>The <EM>SOURCE</EM> Attribute is a reference  to another 
  Object that describes the immediate source of the Computation,  for example, a 
  PROCESS Object. </LI></UL>
<H5><A name="5_8_7">5.8.7 Calibration Information</A></H5>The most common method 
of calibration is the computation 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Calibrated Channel = Gain * Uncalibrated Channel  + Offset,  
</BLOCKQUOTE>where the coefficients "Gain" and "Offset"  are computed from two 
measurements (Zero and Plus) of the Uncalibrated  Channel and their two 
corresponding references.  Such a calibration  is acceptable provided that the 
measurements are within a certain  tolerance of the references and the 
coefficients are within a certain  tolerance of their nominal values, e.g., Gain 
= 1 and Offset = 0. 
<P>This method of calibration is not universal,  and as measuring systems become 
more complex the method of calibration  becomes more complex.  Nevertheless, a 
number of interesting calibration  models, although computationally distinct 
from the model shown above,  use the same basic types of information: 
<UL>
  <LI>Uncalibrated Channel measurements  
  <LI>Measurement references  
  <LI>Measurement tolerances  
  <LI>Computed calibration coefficients  
  <LI>Nominal (or reference) coefficient values  
  <LI>Coefficient tolerances </LI></UL>The Objects defined in the next two 
sections  support the recording of a particular generalization of the 
information  listed above. 
<H6><A name="5_8_7_1">5.8.7.1 Calibration-Measurement Objects</A></H6>
Calibration-Measurement  Objects record measurements, references, and tolerances

  <LI><A name="3">3.</A>The <EM>Type</EM> Attribute defines the type  of 
  measurement taken.  Values of this Attribute are dictionary-controlled  terms. 
   For the simple model described earlier, the Type is "Zero"  or "Plus". 
  <LI><A name="4">4.</A>The <EM>Dimension</EM> Attribute specifies  the array 
  structure of samples recorded in the Measurement Attribute,  of the Reference 
  Attribute, of the Maximum-Deviation Attribute,  of the Standard-Deviation 
  Attribute, of the Standard Attribute,  of the Plus-Tolerance Attribute, and of 
  the Minus-Tolerance Attribute  (see §4.4.4). 
  <LI><A name="5">5.</A>The <EM>Measurement</EM> Attribute is a measurement, 
   possibly containing many samples, related to the uncalibrated data  and 
  described by the Type Attribute.  The measurement may represent  values of, an 
  average of, or some other function of the uncalibrated  data. 
  <LI><A name="6">6.</A>The <EM>Sample-Count</EM> Attribute is the  number of 
  samples used to compute the Maximum-Deviation and Standard-Deviation. 
  <LI><A name="7">7.</A>The <EM>Maximum-Deviation</EM> Attribute  is meaningful 
  only when the Measurement Attribute contains a single  sample.  In this case, 
  the measurement is considered to be a mean,  and Maximum-Deviation represents 
  the maximum deviation from this  mean of any sample used to compute the mean.  
  For array samples,  the mean and maximum deviation are computed independently 
  for each  sample Element.  The deviation for any Element from the mean is 
   computed as an absolute value. 
  <LI><A name="8">8.</A>The <EM>Standard-Deviation</EM> Attribute  is meaningful 
  only when the Measurement Attribute contains a single  sample.  In this case, 
  the measurement is considered to be a mean,  and Standard-Deviation represents 
  the statistical standard deviation  of the samples used to compute the mean.  
  For array samples, the  mean and standard deviation are computed independently 
  for each  sample Element. 
  <LI><A name="9">9.</A>The <EM>Begin-Time</EM> Attribute is the  time at which 
  acquisition of the measurement in the Measurement  Attribute began.  The Value 
  of this Attribute represents either  an absolute date and time (if using 
  Representation Code DTIME) or  an elapsed time from the file creation time 
  specified by the Creation-Time  Attribute of the Origin Object. 
  <LI><A name="10">10.</A>The <EM>Duration</EM> Attribute is a time  interval 
  representing the acquisition duration of the measurement  in the Measurement 
  Attribute. 
  <LI><A name="11">11.</A>The <EM>Reference</EM> Attribute is the  expected 
  nominal value of a single sample of the measurement represented  in the 
  Measurement Attribute. 
  <LI><A name="12">12.</A>The <EM>Standard</EM> Attribute is the measurable 
   quantity of the calibration standard used to produce the Value of  the 
  Measurement Attribute.  For example, a standard used to calibrate  a caliper 
  is a steel ring.  Its measurable quantity is its inside  diameter, say 8 
  inches.  The Measurement and Reference Attributes  may represent the same 
  physical quantity as the calibration standard,  e.g., length.  In this case, 
  the Standard provides the same information  as the Reference and is normally 
  absent to avoid redundancy.  It  is possible, however, for the Measurement and 
  Reference Attributes  to represent a different physical quantity, say voltage. 
   In this  case, the Standard Attribute is required to describe the 
  transformation  from the physical quantity represented by the Measurement and 
  Reference  Attributes to the physical quantity of the calibration standard, 
   e.g., from millivolts to inches.  Deriving this transformation may  require 
  the Values of the Standard Attributes from more than one 
   Calibration-Measurement Object. 
  <LI><A name="13">13.</A>The <EM>Plus-Tolerance</EM> Attribute indicates  by 
  how much each measurement sample may exceed a reference and still  be "within 
  tolerance".  Elements of this Attribute are  all non-negative numbers.  If a 
  measurement sample is an array,  then so is its reference and plus tolerance.  
  The convention that  a measurement sample be within tolerance is that each 
  element of  the measurement sample array be less than or equal to the sum of 
   the corresponding reference and plus tolerance array elements. <BR>The plus 
  tolerance represents in some sense  the maximum acceptable drift of each 
  recorded measurement sample  <U>above</U> the value of the recorded reference. 
   If the Plus-Tolerance  Attribute is absent, then the plus tolerance is 
  implicitly infinite. <BR>For the common simple case when a measurement  sample 
  is scalar, the sample value 352 is within tolerance when  its reference is 350 
  and its plus tolerance is 5.  It is out of  tolerance when its reference is 
  300 and its plus tolerance is 50. 
  <LI><A name="14">14.</A>The <EM>Minus-Tolerance</EM> Attribute indicates  by 
  how much each measurement sample may fall below a reference and  still be 
  "within tolerance".  Elements of this Attribute  are all non-negative numbers. 
   If a measurement sample is an array,  then so is its reference and minus 
  tolerance.  The convention that  a measurement sample be within tolerance is 
  that each element of  the measurement sample array be greater than or equal to 
  the difference  of the corresponding reference and minus tolerance array 
  elements. <BR>The minus tolerance represents in some sense  the maximum 
  acceptable drift of each recorded measurement sample  <U>below</U> the value 
  of the recorded reference.  If the Minus-Tolerance  Attribute is absent, then 
  the minus tolerance is implicitly infinite. <BR>For the common simple case 
  when a measurement  sample is scalar, the sample value 348 is within tolerance 
  when  its reference is 350 and its minus tolerance is 5.  It is out of 
   tolerance when its reference is 400 and its minus tolerance is 50. </LI></UL>
