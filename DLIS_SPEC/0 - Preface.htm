  <LI>This standard was prepared by the API Subcommittee on Recommended  Format 
  for Digital Well Log Data.  The content is based on a concept  and proposal 
  originally submitted to API by Schlumberger Well Services.  This publication 
  was under jurisdiction of the American Petroleum  Institute Production 
  Department's Executive Committee on  Drilling and Production Practices until 
  June 1998, when Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (POSC) accepted its 
   stewardship.  
  <LI>This publication specifies a format for digital well log data, called 
   here the Digital Log Interchange Standard (DLIS).  This format may  be used 
  for the recording of well log data on magnetic tape as well  as on other 
  storage media.  
  <LI>Anyone may use this standard who desires to do so, subject to the terms of 
  the  <A href="http://www.posc.org/about/license.shtml">        POSC Software 
  License Agreement</A>. <!-- -- API publications may be used by anyone desiring to do so.  Every 
effort has been made by API to assure the accuracy and reliability 
of data contained in this publication.  However, the Institute makes

technology

developing technology, equipment improvements, or improved operational 
precedures.  This standard does not obviate the need for qualified 
engineering and operations analyses and sound judgment 
regarding specific 
applications.

<H3><A name="SPECIAL_NOTES">SPECIAL NOTES</A></H3>API RP66 V1 was originally 
published by the API in May 1991  with a clause indicating that it would not be 
considered  an operative API styandard  five years after its publication date, 
unless reaffirmed  or republished.   This document, POSC RP66 V1, is considered 
to be applicable  indefinitely, i. e., until withdrawn or deprecated by POSC, 
with no requirement for periodic reaffirmation or  extension.

<H3><A name="NOTATION">Notation: How Is This Document Written?</A></H3>Numerous 
cases of unusual capitalization appear in this document.   Capitalized terms 
have special, formal, technical connotations in a  DLIS context; these terms do 
not retain  their normal English connotations.  When such a special term is 
first introduced, it is italicized. 
<P>Acronyms are fully defined before they are used. 
<P>Many figures include comment numbers that associate a particular item  with a 
comment that appears below the figure.  For example,
