<P><B><FONT face="Times" size="4"><A name="1_1">1.1 Aim: Why Introduce a New 
Standard?</A> </FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2"></FONT>
<P align="JUSTIFY"><FONT face="Times" size="2">A considerable  investment exists 
in data recorded under current formats,  as well as in software to read and 
process that data.  For  these reasons, changes in the way logging information 
is recorded  are bound to create inconveniences for both the service companies 
 that write the data and the oil companies that read the data.</FONT></P><FONT 
face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">However, as service companies have developed  new 
capabilities in data acquisition and have extended new  services to clients, the 
need to offer flexibility not available  under current log data recording 
formats is evident.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">A number of enhanced data recording techniques  have been 
designed in response to the requirements of new  logging technologies and 
methods, as well as to requests from  clients for more complete information on 
the recorded data.  While some of the enhancements could have been implemented 
 within current formats, others required the introduction of  new concepts and 
mechanisms for the representation of information.  The result is a more 
efficient and powerful standard for  log information recording which is referred 
to as the Digital  Log Interchange Standard (DLIS).</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">The following sections outline the nature  of the most 
significant enhancements incorporated in the DLIS.</P></FONT><B><FONT face="Times" 
size="4">
<P> <A name="1_2">1.2 Data Objects</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">The DLIS provides  a more powerful mechanism for recording 
<I>Frame</I> <I>Data</I>,  <I>Static</I> <I>Information</I>, and 
<I>Transient</I> <I>Information</I> by means of a uniform syntax and an "object 
oriented"  approach.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">Frame Data consists of the values of <I>Data</I> 
<I>Channels</I> as stored in Frames.  Static Information is  information that 
establishes an environment in which Frame  Data can be understood.  Transient 
Information is information  that occurs during the processing of Frame Data or 
that modifies  Static Information.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">New mechanisms for information representations  offer greater 
compactness, uniformity and coherence.  The  standard supports the definition of 
<I>Objects</I> that are  described in terms of <I>Attribute</I>s and may be 
organized  in <I>Set</I>s.  This general technique for defining and representing 
 new information allows the range of information items that  can be represented 
under the DLIS to be extended indefinitely.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" 
size="4">
<P><A name="1_3">1.3 Origins</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">The DLIS provides  a means for unambiguous identification of 
Data Channels by  using Origin information.  The Origin concept provides for 
 uniquely tagging Data Channels from different borehole passes  and descents in 
such a way that they subsequently can be merged  and still remain 
distinguishable.  Origin Objects also provide  summary information about the 
circumstances surrounding the  recording of Channels.  For example, the well 
identification,  the date and time, and the original file specification are 
 recorded as Attributes of Origin Objects.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" 
size="4">
<P><A name="1_4">1.4 Multiple Frame Types</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" 
size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the most  significant new capability is the allowance 
for defining and  recording of multiple Frame types in a single data file.  
 This permits Frames to be organized by indexing (i.e., time-based  Frames can 
co-exist with depth-based Frames), or by sampling  rate (i.e., distinct Frames 
to collect data at 6" and  2" intervals).  This capability facilitates making 
measurements  with different tools at different depth intervals.  The sampling 
 frequency can be adjusted to the depth resolution of the measurements, 
 permitting optimization of the amount of recorded data.  Additionally,  the 
possibility of interleaving Frames of different types  within a log file permits 
embedding station measurements within  a continuous depth log data 
file.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" size="4">
<P><A name="1_5">1.5 Update Objects</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">Under current  formats, Parameters are set before the start 
of a log run  and then recorded at the beginning of the data file. Even  though 
the operator or the system may change certain Parameters  during the log, these 
changes go unrecorded.  This has led  to difficulties in processing the data 
after the fact.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">The DLIS permits changes to be recorded  in the form of 
Update Objects, so that Parameters can be correctly  updated when a log is 
processed.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" size="4">
<P><A name="1_6">1.6 Source References and Calibration Objects</A> 
</P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">The DLIS introduces  two new types of information in the form 
of source references  and Calibration Objects.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">Source references are a mechanism for data  Channels to 
specify their immediate source history to a Tool  or Process Object, and for 
Process Objects to specify their  input and output Channels.  This allows a path 
to be traced  from a computed or acquired Channel all the way back through  its 
source history.</P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">Calibration Objects provide a greatly improved  way of 
recording calibration measurements.  Associated with  each calibrated Channel, 
the new Objects allow recording of  extensive information about the 
calibration.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" size="4">
<P><A name="1_7">1.7 Data Encryption</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" 
size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">Though the actual  methods for encryption lie outside the 
domain of the DLIS,  the standard does allow for encryption at the level of the 
 bodies of Logical Records.</P></FONT> <B><FONT face="Times" size="4">
<P><A name="1_8">1.8 Logical Record</A> </P></FONT></B> <FONT face="Times" size="2">
<P align="JUSTIFY">The DLIS introduces  a more efficient approach to mapping 
logical structures to  the physical structure of the recording medium.  Multiple 
 Logical Records can be packed into the same physical record.  Additional 
mechanisms for Logical Record continuation permit  independence from physical 
record boundaries.  Improved data  recovery capability is provided by a checksum 
at the Logical  Record Segment level and both header and trailer Logical Record 
 Lengths.</P></FONT> </BODY></HTML>
