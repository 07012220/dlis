<H3>Appendix D<BR>CHANGEABLE ATTRIBUTES</H3>Most of the Attributes  of Objects 
that are recorded in a Logical File must remain constant,  i.e., must not be 
changed by means of an Update Object, either because  it would make no sense to 
do so or because it would apply too great  a burden on the Consumer to 
anticipate and react to the change.
<P></P>
<P align="JUSTIFY">Certain other Attributes correspond to values that  may 
change during the acquisition or computation process, and these  changes are 
recorded by the use of Update Objects.  Figure D-1 lists  those Attributes, 
organized by Object Type, that are specifically <U>allowed</U> to change within 
a Logical File, and applications must be prepared to  deal properly with the 
changes.  Applications may assume that Attributes  that are not in this list or 
that are not otherwise indicated changeable  by the standard remain constant 
throughout a Logical File. 
<P>Application designers must be aware that these statements  assert a specific 
prohibition against the changing within programs of  certain information 
associated with DLIS Objects.  Once such information  is recorded in a Logical 
File and while the Logical File is being recorded,  that information must not 
change within the program that writes to the  Logical File unless that 
information corresponds to one of the Attributes  listed in Figure D-1.  Of 
course, no constraint on changes to information  within a program exist before 
that information is written to a Logical  File and after the Logical File has 
been closed.

<P>Comments:

  <LI><A name="cmt_d_1">1.</A> When the Dimension Attribute of a Channel Object 
   changes, it may be due to a change in the positions and number of array 
   elements along a coordinate axis.  Thus, the Coordinates and Spacing 
   Attributes may require changing to keep in synch.  Update Objects that 
   specify changes in this Attribute must specify The Frame Type and Frame 
   Number of the Frame at which the change takes effect.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_2">2.</A> The CoefficientS Attribute may change to reflect 
   manual adjustments in the calibration of a Channel.  No specific requirements 
   are made here regarding the usage of the Attributes of the Update Object, 
   since different methods of calibration may require different kinds of 
   information to specify when the change takes effect.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_3">3.</A> The Dimension Attribute affects the contents  of 
  a particular Slot in a particular Frame Type.  A typical type of  update is to 
  indicate that a Channel is absent or to indicate its presence  after having 
  been absent.  Update Objects that specify changes in this  Attribute must 
  provide exactly one Frame Type and one Frame Number specifying  the Frame at 
  which the change takes effect.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_4">4.</A> The PROPERTIES Attribute of a spliced Channel 
   may not be the same for all ranges of its Index, since the corresponding 
   Properties of the input Channels of the spliced Channel may be different.  
  These changes may be indicated by means of updating the PROPERTIES  Attribute 
  of the spliced Channel in synchronization with the splice  points of its input 
  Channels.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_5">5.</A> The Status Attribute reflects the operational 
   status of the equipment.  Update Objects that specify changes in this 
   Attribute must specify the Borehole Depth of the Tool Zero Point at  the time 
  that the particular equipment status changed.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_6">6.</A> The Vertical-Depth, Radial-Drift, and 
  Angular-Drift  Attributes specify the position of equipment (almost always 
  surface  equipment) that is normally stationary.  Occasionally equipment will 
   move during a logging run.  For example, geophones positioned on the  ocean 
  surface will change vertical position relative to the Well Reference  Point 
  due to tide motion.  Updates of these Attributes can reflect such  slow 
  changes. Updates of these Attributes should not be used  to indicate motion of 
  equipment that is normally non-stationary.  In  fact, these Attributes should 
  normally be absent for such equipment.  Dynamic position of such equipment can 
  best be conveyed via Channel  and Path Objects.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_7">7.</A> The VALUES attribute of a PARAMETER Object may be 
  updated if and only if the Parameter is Unzoned, namely, if and  only if the 
  ZONES Attribute of the PARAMETER Object is Absent.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_8">8.</A> The Process Object is generally recorded before 
   the Frames containing its output Channels.  The final status of the  process 
  may not be known until after all associated Frames have been  written.  Thus, 
  the initial Status of a Process Object may be ‘In-Progress’,  while its final 
  Status may be ‘Aborted’ or ‘Complete’.  In case there  is a system crash, the 
  final Status may also be ‘In-Progress  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_9">9.</A> When a splice operation begins, it may not  be 
  known what all of the input Channels will be.  It must be possible  to provide 
  this information on the fly.  The INPUT-CHANNELS Attribute  may be updated if 
  and only if the ZONES Attribute is Absent.  In this  case, the Count of 
  INPUT-CHANNELS is 1, and an update indicates a change  in the input Channel at 
  the Frames indicated by the UPDATE Object.  
  <LI><A name="cmt_d_10">10.</A> The Status Attribute reflects the operational 
   status of a tool.  Update Objects that specify changes in this Attribute 
   must specify the Borehole Depth of the Tool Zero Point at the time that  the 
  particular tool status changed. </LI></UL></BODY></HTML>
