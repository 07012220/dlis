<P>Appendix C:<BR><A name="C">PROPERTY INDICATORS</A></P></H3>Property 
Indicators  are used to indicate the general intrinsic properties of the data 
 associated with an Object (typically, but not exclusively, a Channel  Object) 
and the general processing steps that have been performed  to create that data.  
The Property Indicators listed below are  not mutually exclusive and may be 
associated in various combinations  with the data of a particular Object. 
<P>It is important to understand the general nature  of Property Indicators.  
 They are intended to provide broad classifications  for Objects.  Such 
classifications can help the Consumer decide  how to handle the Object, i.e., 
based on what has been done to  the data of an Object decide what needs to be 
done next.  For example,  the Property Indicator that the data associated with a 
Channel  has been filtered does not indicate what the specific filtering 
 algorithm was.  However, it may indicate that additional filtering  is 
unnecessary. 
<P>Property Indicators are dictionary-controlled  Codes (Representation Code 
IDENT).

    <TD><B>Property Indicator Options   </B>
    <TD><B>Description  </B>
  <TR>
    <TD>AVERAGED   
    <TD>The data is the average of two or more other data sources.  
  <TR>
    <TD>CALIBRATED   
    <TD>A calibration process has been applied to the data.  
  <TR>
    <TD>CHANGED-INDEX   
    <TD>The data has been resampled along an index       that is different 
      from its original sampling index.       For example, data that was 
      originally sampled       according to time is resampled according to 
      depth.  
  <TR>
    <TD>COMPUTED   
    <TD>The data is an output of a transform, e.g.,       function former, 
      based on input data from a single tool.    
  <TR>
    <TD>DEPTH-MATCHED   
    <TD>The data has been aligned along       its depth index against a 
      reference data source.  
  <TR>
    <TD>DERIVED   
    <TD>The data is an output of empirical       equations or is the solution 
      of log response equations based on       input data from more than one 
      tool.  
  <TR>
    <TD>FILTERED   
    <TD>A filtering process has been applied       to the data.  
  <TR>
    <TD>HOLE-SIZE-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected       for hole size effect based on the 
      value of a hole size input.  
  <TR>
    <TD>INCLINOMETRY-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been       corrected to standard directional references 
      (vertical axis and       North axis).  
  <TR>
    <TD>LITHOLOGY-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been computed       or corrected based on the value of a 
      matrix lithology parameter.  
  <TR>
    <TD>LOCAL-COMPUTATION   
    <TD>The data is the result       of locally-defined computational 
      expressions.        Such data is normally experimental.  
  <TR>
    <TD>LOCALLY-DEFINED   
    <TD>The Object's Name has been created by the operator.        This Name 
      might not be dictionary-controlled       and may have no semantic 
      association with the Object's data.  
  <TR>
    <TD>MODELLED   
    <TD>The data is the output of a theoretical       model and is not derived 
      from any measured quantity.  
  <TR>
    <TD>MUDCAKE-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected for mud cake effect.  
  <TR>
    <TD>NORMALIZED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected so       that its range corresponds to a 
      prescribed norm.  
  <TR>
    <TD>OVER-SAMPLED   
    <TD>Interpolated data samples have       been added to the original data 
      to align this       data with other data.  
  <TR>
    <TD>PATCHED   
    <TD>The original data values have been       replaced at specific levels.  
            This is normally done to remove spurious       values (e.g., 
      spikes).  
  <TR>
    <TD>PRESSURE-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected       for hydrostatic pressure (mud 
      weight).  
  <TR>
    <TD>RE-SAMPLED   
    <TD>The data has been resampled along its original index.        For 
      example, as the result of a depth correction       process it is 
      determined that       the original index values are incorrect.       Using 
      a curve fitting process it is possible to determine new       data values 
      for the original index values       that represent the original signal 
      more accurately.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SALINITY-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected for salinity effect.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SAMPLED-DOWNWARD   
    <TD>The original sampling direction is downward.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SAMPLED-UPWARD   
    <TD>The original sampling direction is upward.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SPEED-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected       for variations of the downhole tool 
      speed.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SPLICED   
    <TD>The data has been obtained by concatenating       two or more other 
      data sources.  
  <TR>
    <TD>SQUARED   
    <TD>The data is the result of a squaring       process, i.e., a process 
      that converts a smooth function       into a step function.  
  <TR>
    <TD>STACKED   
    <TD>The data is the sum of two or more other data sources.  
  <TR>
    <TD>STANDARD-DEVIATION   
    <TD>The data represents the       estimated standard deviation, due to     
        environmental factors or incoherence       of the computational model, 
      of another data source.  
  <TR>
    <TD>STANDOFF-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected       for standoff effect.  
  <TR>
    <TD>TEMPERATURE-CORRECTED   
    <TD>The data has been corrected       for temperature effect based on      
       the value of a temperature source.  
  <TR>
    <TD>UNDER-SAMPLED   
    <TD>Some of the original data samples       have been discarded to reduce 
      the amount of data       or to align this data with other data.
